# RLE Encoder/Decoder for ASCII art
## RLE:
[wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-length_encoding)

## Features:
- Decoding RLE into text
- Displaying ascii art from a file or from decoding
- Encoding text into RLE 

## How to use:
- When you start the program, a menu will be printed:
```
Please pick a number: 
	1. Enter (RLE) encoded ASCII art
	2. Display ASCII art
	3. Convert to ASCII art
	4. Convert to RLE
	5. Quit
=> 
```
- Pick an option by typing the number of it and pressing enter
- Pretty self explanatory from then on

**Files should be stored in the folder `./files` (relative to `main.py`)**
